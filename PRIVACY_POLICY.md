## üîê Privacy Policy

Bleachify is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding the data we collect, store, and use. This section outlines the types of data we handle and how we manage them.

### 1. Data Collection

We only collect data that is essential to the operation and improvement of the Bleachify bot. Examples of collected data include:

- The number of characters unlocked by a user
- Daily voting activity
- Executed command inputs (e.g., `/register referral: 343344`)

We **do not** collect or store message content, personally identifiable information, or any unrelated user data.

### 2. Data Usage

Collected data is used strictly for:

- Improving bot performance and user experience
- Tracking user progression and engagement (e.g., referrals, in-game stats)
- Preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage of bot features

Command input logs may be retained for a limited duration (typically one month to one year) to support analytics and debugging.

### 3. Data Retention and Deletion

Users may request access to, or deletion of, their data at any time.

However, for banned users, certain data (such as user identifiers) may be retained to prevent ban evasion or abuse of the system. Requests from such users may be subject to additional verification or restrictions.

### 4. Data Security

At present, Bleachify does not store sensitive credentials. Should this change in the future, all such data will be securely encrypted and stored in accordance with modern security practices.

### 5. Compliance with GDPR

While Bleachify does not collect personally identifiable information (PII), we support the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for our users in the European Union. Users have the right to:

- Access the data associated with their Discord ID
- Request data deletion (with exceptions for abuse prevention)
- Request correction of inaccurate records
